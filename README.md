# Simple-E-com-Store
This project is a lightweight PHP-based e-commerce web application for selling fashion items (like shirts). It allows users to view product listings, see product details, add items to a cart, update cart quantities, and proceed to checkout. It uses PHP, MySQL, and HTML/CSS, and stores cart data using PHP sessions tied to session IDs.
